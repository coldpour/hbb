        Natalie and Ann met through YMCA Camp Menogyn in 2007. They went on the 
        same seven week trip on the Kazan and Kunwak Inuit heritage rivers of 
        Nunavut, Canada, ending in Baker Lake. After this monumental trip, both 
        Natalie and Ann attended St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN.

        <b>Natalie</b> grew up in Miami, Florida where she attended the New World School 
        of the Arts for saxophone performance. In 2005, she flew to Minneapolis 
        and headed north to Menogyn. After a two week canoeing trip in the BWCA, 
        Natalie fell in love with the wilderness and later decided to pursue an 
        Environmental Studies degree at St. Olaf. In the fall of 2010, Natalie 
        participated in a Higher Education Consortium for Urban Affairs (HECUA) 
        program in Minneapolis where she delved further into the world of environmental 
        sustainability. She spends her free time playing the saxophone, dressing up 
        as a bear, and working on organic farms.

        <b>Ann</b> grew up in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota where she attended Convent of 
        the Visitation High School. For most of her life, Ann's family brought her 
        adventuring in the north woods to their cabin at the end of the Gunflint 
        Trail. In 2008, Ann worked as a cook for Camp Menogyn and in 2009 and 2010 
        she worked as a trail guide. At St. Olaf she majored in mathematics with a 
        concentration in environmental studies. Ann is interested in going to graduate 
        school for population ecology in the distant future. She likes to play ultimate 
        and cause trouble.

      "Ann Raiho and Natalie Warren graduated from St Olaf College in Northfield, Minn., last Saturday. While a lot of new grads don’t know where they are headed, Raiho (mathematics) and Warren (environmental studies) already had their course charted. And they had the paddles, the tent, the canoe and the gear — including a 12-gauge shotgun — to make their journey."
